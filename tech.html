				<p>Cities worldwide have been leaders in recoginizing and taking action against climate change. There are many potential reasons for this:</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Severe weather events impacts are more accute in cities, given their concentration of infrastructure, economic activity, and population </li>
				<li>Cities have resources available from their broad revenue streams that can be devoted to mitigation initiatives</li>
				<li>The rising cost of energy in recent years has motivated some cities to provide alternative modes of transport to the passenger vehicle</li>
				<li>Rising operating costs have made more resource-intensive low-density development a greater liabitiy, providing motivation for well-connected, transit-oriented design</li>
				<li>A higher-educated, more progressive voter base that expects government to make globally-minded, long term decisions</li>
				</ul>
				<p>These are of course somewhat speculative and vary in their geographical relevance. However, the awareness necessary for cities to take action seems to be in place. Residents and governments are able to identify clear ways in which they can reduce their climate impact. A very good analysis of the types of measures that cities were implementing in various sectors was provided by <a href="http://publications.arup.com/Publications/C/Climate_Action_in_Megacities.aspx">Arup</a> in 2011. However, one question that we might consider is what role technology can play in reducing our emissions? Countries around the world have started to invest in renewable energy technologies, citizens and businesses are making efforts to retrofit their buildings, and there seems to be a growing interest in transportation that emits lower levels of carbon (e.g., public transit, as well as electric vehicles of all types). <em> Given that these technologies are being adopted, do we even need to make a concerted effort to reduce emissions?  Will technology save us through the free market and with current carbon reduction policies?</em></p>

				<p>This was the question my doctoral supervisor and I set out to answer, focusing on the Greater Toronto Area. We looked at the current provincial and regional policies in place.  We looked at the adoption of energy retrofits, and the adoption of new vehicles. We created scenarios of the decarbonization of the electricity grid.  We wanted to see what impact technological changes can have, assuming we held things like home energy demand, the amount people travel, and economic growth fixed.</p>

				So out of curiosity, I set out to quantify the greenhouse gas emissions that residents in various Canadian cities would be responsible for just be the act of operating their house. Of course, this wouldn't include emissions from transporting themselves away from their house, or consuming non-energy resouces within their house, but just the day-to-day operations - cooking, turning on the lights, washing the dishes, showering, heating, cooling, and so on. Because Canadian cities developed at different times and have access to different resources, there is bound to be a difference in the characteristics of their residential building stock and the types of energy they consume. With the aid of my co-author, I explored just how different my selected Canadian cities are in the residential carbon emissions. You can see the result (in tonnes of CO2e annually) from the average person living in the average home in 2010 presented in the figure below.</p>

							data : [1.0, 4.1, 1.0, 1.8, 0.3, 5.6]

				<h3> Explaining These Results
				</h3>
				<p>So why does a resident of Halifax have a such a drastically higher household carbon footprint than a resident of Montreal? Well, the underlying abundance of electricity has a huge role to play. First, whatever applications that use electricity in the household (lighting, appliances, heating, etc) are inherently low carbon, which is a nice starting place.  Next, because electricity is just so abundant in the province, you can use it in applications that you wouldn't have otherwise, specifically space and water heating. So when a Montrealer cranks up their thermostat, the energy is mostly sourced from clean, hydroelectric (and increasingly wind) power. But when a Haligonian seeks reprieve from the blustery maritime winters, the energy comes from fuel oil or the coal-heavy electricity grid.  
				</p>
				<p>One thing that did surprise us was just how little an impact a city's development history had. Montreal has a larger collection of older buildings when compared to a city that has seen a lot of recent development, such as Edmonton. However these differences are overwhelmed by the effects of the choice of fuels within households and within the regional grid. As a result, you can see that a city's emissions are more or less in line with the carbon intensity of their electricity grid.</p>
				
				<h3>How do we improve the carbon intensity of the grid?</h3>
				<p>Now that we know that a clean grid can mean guilt-free living (from a carbon perspective) in Montreal & Winnipeg, the next question becomes how do we all get to this point. Clearly not every province is endowed with the hydroelectric resource available in Manitoba, British Columbia or Quebec. So what can those provinces do? Carbon neutrality in these cities will require a dramatic reduction in energy demand that can be sufficiently met by local/imported low-carbon electricity. So it's a matter of creating an environment where demand reduction occurs naturally, through the market. A price on carbon is the first step. Other important approaches were discussed by Jesse Row and I in a <a href="http://www.pembina.org/pub/2528">Pembina Institute publication</a>, with some key approaches being:
				<ul>
				<li>Mandatory building energy labeling, so that people know the energy performance of the buildings they buy/rent</li>
				<li>Informative billing / home energy reports so that people understand how their energy consumption compares with their neighbours</li>
				<li>Aggressive building code improvements to ensure future homes are built to a very high energy performance standard (to give you an idea, <a href="http://www.annex40.net/fileadmin/user_upload/annex40.net/publications/HPC_NSERC_Annex40_WS_SE.pdf">Sweden has discussed</a> making residential buildings require no more than 75 kWh per square metre by 2020 - the average Canadian house used over 200 kWh per square metre in 2011</li>
				</ul>
